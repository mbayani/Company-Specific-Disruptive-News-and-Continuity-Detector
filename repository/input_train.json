Under the terms of the Board's consent cease and desist order, US Bancorp must strengthen oversight of firmwide risk-management and compliance programs for preventing violations of anti-money-laundering and U.S. sanctions laws and put in place procedures to ensure it provides adequate and complete responses to examiner inquiries. In a separate action, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the execution of a deferred prosecution agreement with US Bancorp for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act that occurred at its national bank subsidiary. The deferred prosecution agreement provides for a $528 million forfeiture by US Bancorp. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced penalties of $75 million and $185 million respectively against U.S. Bancorp's national bank subsidiary for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act"

"text": "The Federal Reserve took action on Wednesday against Goldman Sachs and one of its former executives, escalating a long-running investigation into a leak of confidential government information. The action, which forced Goldman to pay a $36.3 million penalty, stemmed from an incident in 2014, when a junior Goldman banker took confidential information from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The junior banker, whom Goldman promptly fired, received the information from a New York Fed employee. Both men pleaded guilty to stealing government property, and Goldman paid a $50 million penalty to New York State regulators because its management failed to effectively supervise the banker. The Fed did not act against Goldman at the time, making its decision to pursue Goldman now a somewhat unusual move. The action, which cites Goldman for an unauthorized use and disclosure of confidential supervisory information, is also an awkward one for the Fed"

"text": "After more than a year of criminal and regulatory investigations, the nation's two largest banks agreed yesterday to pay almost $300 million in fines and penalties to settle accusations that they aided Enron in misrepresenting its true financial condition for years before the company collapsed. The settlements, with J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, are the broadest to date reached with advisers that played roles in the financing and structuring of the off-the-books partnerships and transactions that contributed significantly to the collapse of Enron in December 2001. The only other such settlement, for $80 million from Merrill Lynch & Company, involved two transactions over a short period; the accusations against the banks involved a range of deals over many years that investigators say were used to portray borrowed money as cash generated by Enron's business. But the bank settlements -- reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorney's office -- have a significance far beyond the issues in the Enron case. That is because, for the most part, the transactions between Enron and the banks met legal and accounting requirements but still led to what regulators said was misleading information in the company's financial reports. [News analysis, Page C1.] As a result, these settlements are a strong signal that corporate advisers will be held responsible for the financial effect of their dealings with clients -- meaning that banks, accountants and lawyers can be held responsible if a transaction is legal in every respect but results in a outcome that deceives investors"

The settlement, which is awaiting court approval in California, comes amid six months of continual fallout for Wells Fargo, the second-largest commercial bank in the United States. To recap: Amid intense pressure to meet impossible cross-sales targets from branch managers, employees opened some 1.5 million fake bank accounts and issued over half a million credit cards without customer approval. In September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued the bank a $100 million penalty, the largest on record, for the illegal practice. The bank also paid an additional $85 million in fines and agreed to refund $2.5 million to its customers for fees associated with the phony accounts."

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo (Reuters)Walls Fargo has suffered from numerous gaffes in the past few years. In 2016, the bank paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle with regulators over its phony account sales tactic scandal that saw the bank open more than 2 million accounts without customer authorization.In 2018, the company came under fire over practices related to retirement plans, sales of add-on products and how it represented loan quality for mortgages it made before the 2008 financial crisis. At least a dozen Wells Fargo Securities employees were fired or suspended over allegations they doctored dinner receipts and improperly charged the bills to the company. And the bank admitted that November that hundreds of customers lost their homes after a calculation error denied them mortgage changes. Earlier this year, a data center power issue caused major outages for Wells Fargo, affecting its app, website, credit cards and ATMs. In July, the company agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle allegations that it signed up thousands of auto loan customers for car insurance without their consent, a practice which resulted in many of the vehicles being repossessed.The bank called rebuilding trust after the scandals a priority in the recent SEC filing. The company’s board has been reviewing sales practices and a third-party consulting firm reviewed years of retail banking accounts to look for any issues. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate, the company said. This effort to identify other instances in which customers may have experienced harm is ongoing, and it is possible that we may identify other areas of potential concern."

"text": "Attorney General Eric Holder and Associate Attorney General Tony West announced today that the Department of Justice has reached a $16.65 billion settlement with Bank of America Corporation – the largest civil settlement with a single entity in American history ­— to resolve federal and state claims against Bank of America and its former and current subsidiaries, including Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch. As part of this global resolution, the bank has agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) – the largest FIRREA penalty ever – and provide billions of dollars of relief to struggling homeowners, including funds that will help defray tax liability as a result of mortgage modification, forbearance or forgiveness. The settlement does not release individuals from civil charges, nor does it absolve Bank of America, its current or former subsidiaries and affiliates or any individuals from potential criminal prosecution. This historic resolution - the largest such settlement on record - goes far beyond the cost of doing business, said Attorney General Holder. Under the terms of this settlement, the bank has agreed to pay $7 billion in relief to struggling homeowners, borrowers and communities affected by the bank’s conduct. This is appropriate given the size and scope of the wrongdoing at issue. This settlement is part of the ongoing efforts of President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force and its Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) Working Group, which has recovered $36.65 billion to date for American consumers and investors. At nearly $17 billion, today’s resolution with Bank of America is the largest the department has ever reached with a single entity in American history, said Associate Attorney General West. “But the significance of this settlement lies not just in its size; this agreement is notable because it achieves real accountability for the American people and helps to rectify the harm caused by Bank of America’s conduct through a $7 billion consumer relief package that could benefit hundreds of thousands of Americans still struggling to pull themselves out from under the weight of the financial crisis."

"text": "A U.S. appeals court on Monday threw out a jury’s finding that Bank of America Corp was liable for mortgage fraud leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, voiding a $1.27 billion penalty and dealing the U.S. Department of Justice a major setback. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York found insufficient proof under federal fraud statutes to establish Bank of America’s liability over a mortgage program called Hustle run by the former Countrywide Financial Corp. The Justice Department claimed Countrywide, which Bank of America bought in July 2008, defrauded government-sponsored mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by selling them thousands of toxic loans. But in a 3-0 decision, U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley said the evidence at most showed that Countrywide breached contracts to sell investment-quality loans, and that there was no proof it intended any deception. The trial evidence fails to demonstrate the contemporaneous fraudulent intent necessary to prove a scheme to defraud through contractual promises,” Wesley wrote. Bank of America said it was pleased with the ruling. A spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office pursued the case, had no immediate comment. The lawsuit was filed in 2012 following a whistleblower’s complaint, and remains one of the biggest government enforcement cases to go to trial in connection with the U.S. housing meltdown and financial crisis."
