"text": "Embattled Wells Fargo is accused of adding on to fraud victims' troubles by closing their accounts without investigating potential criminal activity, a new lawsuit by an ex-fraud investigator for the bank claims, echoing customer complaints.By law, a bank is supposed to investigate potential criminal activity when a customer complains of fraud. Instead, according to Matthew Valles, who worked as a fraud investigator for Wells Fargo in Portland, Oregon, the bank closed the accounts and got rid of the customer. On Wednesday he sued the bank and his former manager for violating whistleblower laws, alleging he had been fired in retaliation for his complaints about hundreds of mishandled cases."
