"text": "Wall Street seems to agree. Wells Fargo's shares rose 3% in after-hours trading following the news. About damn time Warren tweeted on Thursday following the news of Sloan's exit. He enabled Wells Fargo's massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, & then helped cover it up. Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, urged the SEC and Justice Department to investigate Sloan for his role in Wells Fargo's problems. And if he's guilty of any crimes, she said, he should be put in jail like anyone else.  Wells Fargo's statement made no reference to wrongdoing by Sloan."
