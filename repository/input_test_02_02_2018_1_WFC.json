"text": "The Federal Reserve on Friday imposed unusually harsh penalties on Wells Fargo, punishing it for years of misconduct and barring it from future growth until the bank fixes its problems. The central bank blasted Wells Fargo’s board for failing to oversee the bank, and it announced that the company would replace four members of its 16-person board by the end of the year. The move, taking place on Janet L. Yellen’s last working day as the central bank’s chairwoman, is all the more extraordinary because it comes at a time when federal banking regulators appointed by President Trump are working vigorously to relax rules that were imposed in the years following the financial crisis. The Fed’s punishment, a forceful intervention by the government into the affairs of a large company, means that one of the country’s largest and most powerful financial institutions will be unable to keep pace with its fast-growing rivals."
