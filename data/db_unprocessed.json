The central bank blasted Wells Fargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board for failing to oversee the bank, and it announced that the company would replace four members of its 16-person board by the end of the year. The move, taking place on Janet L. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last working day as the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairwoman, is all the more extraordinary because it comes at a time when federal banking regulators appointed by President Trump are working vigorously to relax rules that were imposed in the years following the financial crisis. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s punishment, a forceful intervention by the government into the affairs of a large company, means that one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest and most powerful financial institutions will be unable to keep pace with its fast-growing rivals."}, "2": {"file_name": "input_test_02_04_2018_2_WFC.json", "rec_created": "2019-12-20 18:40:10.986469", "site": "www.nytimes.com", "organization": "Wells Fargo", "published": "2018-02-04T00:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "How Wells Fargo and Federal Reserve Struck Deal to Hold Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board Accountable", "text": "On a Thursday evening in mid-January, a group of top Wells Fargo executives sat down for dinner in an upscale surf-and-turf restaurant near the White House. At nearby tables, power brokers ate seafood on ice and sipped cocktails out of copper mugs. The Wells Fargo executives \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including the chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, and the finance chief, John R. Shrewsberry \u00e2\u20ac\u201d enjoyed their crab legs, but they were in Washington on unpleasant business. The Federal Reserve planned to impose tough sanctions on the San Francisco-based bank for years of misconduct and the shoddy governance that allowed it. The executives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mission, according to three people directly involved in the negotiations, was to avoid further shaking investor confidence in the bank and its management team. Officials at the central bank had a different goal, according to people familiar with their thinking. They wanted to send a message to the Wells board that it would be held responsible for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior."}, "3": {"file_name": "input_test_03_01_2018_3_WFC.json", "rec_created": "2019-12-20 18:40:13.038191", "site": "www.nbcnews.com", "organization": "Wells Fargo", "published": "2018-03-01T00:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wells Fargo hit with yet another lawsuit \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for closing fraud victims' accounts to avoid costs", "text": "Embattled Wells Fargo is accused of adding on to fraud victims' troubles by closing their accounts without investigating potential criminal activity, a new lawsuit by an ex-fraud investigator for the bank claims, echoing customer complaints.By law, a bank is supposed to investigate potential criminal activity when a customer complains of fraud.
