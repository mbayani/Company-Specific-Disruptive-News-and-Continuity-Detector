"text": "Investors had been hoping for a deal this year, or at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.Wall Street is also weighing the potential for an expanded series of trade disputes after a month of relative calm. On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.Technology stocks led the losses. The sector is highly sensitive to twists in the trade dispute because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Apple slumped 2.1% and Intel fell 2.8%.Bank stocks also suffered heavy losses as investors headed for the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower. Banks rely on higher bond yields to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 1.71% from 1.83% late Monday.Bank of America shed 1.8% and Citigroup fell 1.7%.Utilities and real estate companies held up the best as investors shifted money to the safe-play sectors.KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index was down 0.8% as of 3:37 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow fell 299 points, or 1.1%, to 27,483. The index was briefly down 457 points. The Nasdaq fell 0.7%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 0.4%.Asian and European markets also fell.DECEMBER DIP? The lack of a trade deal before the year ends could mean the market is in for a turnaround from a strong, record-setting November. The S&P 500 had its best month since June with a 3.4% gain because of cooling trade tensions and optimism that a resolution to the dispute was near.Two days of deflated hopes has already sent the S&P 500 about 1.5% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slipped 1.8%.December is a typically solid month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 making gains regularly since the last recession ended in 2009. Last year, though, fears about a recession and rising interest rates hurt the major indexes.METAL MARRIAGE: Cleveland-Cliffs plunged 9.9% after the iron-ore miner said it will pay $1.1 billion for steel maker AK Steel. U.S. steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25% steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe. The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30% this year. AK Steel rose 3.8%.DRESSED FOR SUCCESS: Lands’ End vaulted 18.9% after the clothing maker reported surprisingly good fourth-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast for the year.ECONOMIC WATCH: Wall Street still has a busy week ahead for some key economic gauges following disappointing manufacturing and construction data on Monday.Investors will get a better view of the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the economy, with a November report on Wednesday. Economists expect a very slight drop in growth.Employment data is also on tap this week. On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP will release its latest survey of hiring by private companies. The Labor Department will release its closely watched employment report on Friday.COMMODITIES & CURRENCIES: Benchmark crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $56.10 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, slipped 10 cents to close at $60.82 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.56 per gallon. Heating oil declined 1 cent to $1.88 per gallon. Natural gas rose 11 cents to $2.44 per 1,000 cubic feet.Gold rose $15.90 to $1,478.20 per ounce, silver rose 29 cents to $17.13 per ounce and copper fell 2 cents to $2.61 per pound.The dollar fell to 108.57 Japanese yen from 108.98 yen on Monday. The euro strengthened to $1.1082 from $1.1078.AP Business Writer Damian J. Troise contributed.

"text": "On a Thursday evening in mid-January, a group of top Wells Fargo executives sat down for dinner in an upscale surf-and-turf restaurant near the White House. At nearby tables, power brokers ate seafood on ice and sipped cocktails out of copper mugs. The Wells Fargo executives — including the chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, and the finance chief, John R. Shrewsberry — enjoyed their crab legs, but they were in Washington on unpleasant business. The Federal Reserve planned to impose tough sanctions on the San Francisco-based bank for years of misconduct and the shoddy governance that allowed it. The executives’ mission, according to three people directly involved in the negotiations, was to avoid further shaking investor confidence in the bank and its management team. Officials at the central bank had a different goal, according to people familiar with their thinking. They wanted to send a message to the Wells board that it would be held responsible for the company’s behavior."

"text": "The Federal Reserve on Friday imposed unusually harsh penalties on Wells Fargo, punishing it for years of misconduct and barring it from future growth until the bank fixes its problems. The central bank blasted Wells Fargo’s board for failing to oversee the bank, and it announced that the company would replace four members of its 16-person board by the end of the year. The move, taking place on Janet L. Yellen’s last working day as the central bank’s chairwoman, is all the more extraordinary because it comes at a time when federal banking regulators appointed by President Trump are working vigorously to relax rules that were imposed in the years following the financial crisis. The Fed’s punishment, a forceful intervention by the government into the affairs of a large company, means that one of the country’s largest and most powerful financial institutions will be unable to keep pace with its fast-growing rivals."

"text": "The Federal Reserve imposed penalties on Wells Fargo the other week after a cascade of problems surfaced over the last two years, ranging from opening dummy accounts in the names of customers to forcing borrowers to take out unnecessary automobile insurance. The question is whether this is a welcome sign that regulators have not pulled back completely from policing large companies or just a one-time action on an outlier. With the Trump administration focused on easing regulation, involving other companies seems unlikely as long as they stay away from the types of egregious problems that plagued Wells Fargo. The central bank’s order is unprecedented in the extent to which it intrudes on how the bank will be managed. It requires Wells Fargo to enhance the board’s oversight of operations, improve its risk management with an outside review of its progress and — most important — temporarily limit asset growth until its compliance issues are addressed. The Fed also announced that the bank would replace four directors this year, a statement that, although not part of the order, caused much consternation among Wells Fargo’s executives, The New York Times reported. Although the order falls short of a takeover of the bank, it shows just how much the board had failed, in the view of its primary regulator, to meet its basic obligation to ensure that Wells Fargo is managed properly."

Instead, according to Matthew Valles, who worked as a fraud investigator for Wells Fargo in Portland, Oregon, the bank closed the accounts and got rid of the customer. On Wednesday he sued the bank and his former manager for violating whistleblower laws, alleging he had been fired in retaliation for his complaints about hundreds of mishandled cases."

Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, urged the SEC and Justice Department to investigate Sloan for his role in Wells Fargo's problems. And if he's guilty of any crimes, she said, he should be put in jail like anyone else.  Wells Fargo's statement made no reference to wrongdoing by Sloan."
